Hello!

I'm Aapo and I like to try new stuff out and isn't afraid of jumping into the deep end of the projects.'ve been programming now for 8-ish years and 6-ish years professionally.

The projects most representative of my current skills are the back-end with node.js/graphql here: https://github.com/aapo-komppa/graphql-be and front-end with react here: https://github.com/aapo-komppa/react-vitejs-jest
